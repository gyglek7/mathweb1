        <p>Quadratic equations are some of the most complex and important math operations</p>
        <p>Chapter 1: What even are quadratic equations?
            Quadratic equations are math procedures that can be breaken down in a couple of parts. The first part is the square number aka the "a", "a" is an essential part of a quadratic equation 
            differentiating it from a normal equation, most of the times in your examples it will be an x but we refer to it as "a"     example = Xsquared . The second number is called B, it always has atleast one and above of "x", "b" is not an essential number but
            it will be in the equations most of the time. Example of "b" = 5x. Finally lets talk about the third part which is "c", "c" is also not essential and is normally a just a number like "-21". I also want 
            to add that a quadratic is required to have "a" and either "b" or "c", it cannot be just "a". Normally when solving a quadratic you dont look for the average solution but you are trying to find the x's value.  </p>
        <p>Chapter 2: Factorisation.    
            The first thing we do in factorisation cannot always be used but when it is possible it is a good way to solve a quadratic quickly and without much thinking.
            One of the examples we will use for quadratics is a pretty easy equation;  x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0. The answer is (X-2) and (X-3) which then turns into x=2 and x=3 since we 
            need the x to be a specific number that will cause the equation to end up as a zero. For example when you found that its (X+5) then you 
            should know that the final answer should be x=-5 since we need the X to cancel out the +5 and make it a zero</p>
        <p>Chapter 3: Solving quadratics with formula.
            Since factorisation isn't always applicable you need to know another way of solving quadratics and formula is probably the best one, its really hard to make any mistakes with it if its done correctly. The formula is "b"^2 -4*a*c = "D", D is the discriminant
            which is essential in this formula. After we found the discriminant all we need to do is add it to another equation which is -b + the root of D/2*a, then you do the same but you substract the root of D from the -b getting 2 numbers in the process which will be the 
            needed X. Since formula works everytime its definitely a solid option to solve quadratics. Also if D is above zero then there are 2 solutions, if D is zero then there is only one solution and if D is under zero then it has no solution.
        </p>
        <p>Chapter 4: The graphic method
            When learning quadratics you will also need to know the graphic method, it is pretty nice to know and can help solving cubical equations or equations that are similiar to each other but not particularly the same.
            The first thing you need to do when solving with the graphic method is make the coordinate table, generally its recommended to start from x=-3 and end with x=3 but sometimes it might be different.
            After you filled in the coordinate table you make a graph and plotted the lines you now just get to look at the end of equation. For example x^2 -4x + 3 = 0 you just plot the graph and then take the points of the X coordinate that correspond on to the y=0. If the number is above or below zero you just
            scan the x and where the points correspond so if y=6 you just scan the line and find where the points approximately meet.        </p>
